    <h3>Cherry</h3>
    
    <p>A cherry blossom, also known as a Japanese cherry or sakura, is a flower of trees in the genus Prunus or the Prunus subgenus Cerasus.</p>
    <p>Wild species of the cherry tree are widely distributed, mainly in the Northern Hemisphere.[4][5][6] They are common in East Asia, especially in Japan. They generally refer to ornamental cherry trees, not cherry trees grown for their fruit.[7][8] The cherry blossom is considered the national flower of Japan.[9]

        In Europe, from the late 19th century to the early 20th century, Collingwood Ingram collected and studied Japanese cherry blossoms and created various ornamental cultivars. The culture of ornamental cherry blossoms soon began to spread. In the United States, ornamental cherry blossoms began to spread after Japan presented them as a token of friendship in 1912.[10] Cherry blossoms have been described as having a beautiful smell, and have been the inspiration for many candles and incense.</p>
